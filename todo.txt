Create UI controls to filter data
- Filter based on particle type
- Filter based on measurement values for each particle type (e.g. only show co > 1.3, ammonia > 72.9, ...)
- Allow historical data to be retrieved (select a date/time within the last 90 days)
- Use Location IQ API
- Also update search box location to location name when panning the map
- Style the background color of particle values in the table so they match the Air Quality Index from the EPA
- Also include a legend for the colors
- Add option for showing a heatmap visualization overlay on the map when only one particle type selected
- Color should represent the measurement value
- Include an easy-to-read legend
- Allow map (along with the location input box) to go fullscreen
